    "As a soccer fan and season pass holder for the Netherlands' best football club Ajax, it was not hard to choose between the datasets provided for this project. Picking the most interesting research questions, however, was much more difficult: with dozens of variables for matches, teams and individual players, there were literally hundreds of questions to answer. After much thought, I decided to extract two datasets from the SQLite database (the SQL statements that I used are described in the next cell):\n",
    "\n",
    "* Matches (league name, date, home team, away team and the goals scored for the respective teams)\n",
    "* Players (a combination of the tables 'player' and 'player_attributes')\n",
    "\n",
    "For these datasets, I will try to answer the following research questions:\n",
    "1. Is there an advantage for teams to playing in their own stadium (home advantage)?\n",
    "2. How did the Dutch football club Ajax perform over the years, compared to its main competitors PSV and Feyenoord?\n",
    "3. Are there more professional football players born in the first months of the year than in the last months of the year ([relative age effect](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Relative_age_effect))?\n",
    "4. Are there player characteristics that correspond to higher overall rating in the EA Sports FIFA video game? "

For example, the world of difference between the top player with overall ranking of 94 (FC Barcelona's Lionel Messi) and the one with the lowest ranking (the Italian player Francesco Della Rocco who, fortunately for him, was very young when his first ranking was set and later reached an overall rating of 68 (__[source](https://sofifa.com/player/178043)__). The best header (the rather unknown Nicola Zigic), the most agile player (again, Lionel Messi amongst others), the most aggressive player (not surprisingly: Gennaro Gattuso, amongst others) and the one who scores penalties best (Rickie Lambert)... it is tempting to connect all attributes to names. \n",

    "After trying many roads and angles within this extensive dataset, I singled out four research questions. Not every research question were answered to my full satisfaction. For example: I hoped to create a sharper image of the characteristics of top football players than I eventually found in the data. On the other hand, it was nice to see some research questions answered and visualized like I suspected beforehand, for example with the question about the relative birth effect. \n",

    "**A summary of my findings:**\n",
    "\n",
    "*Matches*\n",
    "* The much debated home advantage where football teams benefit from playing in their own stadium does seem to exist. There are differences between the various leagues, though. The cause of these differences is not clear. The hypothesis that the home advantage is larger in larger countries (with longer travel distances between clubs) is not backed up by the data. \n",
    "* Matching with my own observations between 2008 and 2016 ;-), the data did indeed show that Ajax was successful in terms of points earned and goals scored, compared to eternal rivals PSV and Feyenoord. However, Ajax did not entirely live up to its reputation of having an offensive playing style because the team did not score the most goals in the majority of the seasons in the dataset. \n",
    "\n",
    "*Players*\n",
    "* Looking at the months in which the professional football players in this dataset are born, it does seem that the relative age effect is present, because an overrepresentation of players born in the first months of the year can be observed. However, at this moment in time I do not have the tools to test if this overrepresentation is statistically significant or not.\n",
    "* There is a strong correlation between the overall FIFA rating of the player and his reactions, which means that high overall ratings often go together with good reactions. Furthermore, the top 25% players have a larger mean rating on long shots and shot power, followed by ball control, reactions, positioning, vision, volleys and curve (as compared to the bottom 25% players). An important thing to keep in mind though is that these characteristics are no hard numbers but subjective ratings created for a video game. An interesting article on how the ratings are calculated can be found [here](https://www.vg247.com/2016/09/27/how-ea-calculates-fifa-17-player-ratings/).\n",
    "* Goalkeepers are -on average- taller than field players. When comparing top to bottom players, there is also a small difference in weight and height: the top players are -on average- a little lighter and smaller than the bottom players. Although I do not have the means at this point to see if this difference is significant, I suspect that (also taking the BMI into account) that there is no significant difference in weight and height for the top 25% players compared to the bottom 25% players. \n"
